## Developer Workflow

To develop this website, you need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed. You should then start by cloning this repository and entering the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taibeled/JetLagHideAndSeek.git
cd JetLagHideAndSeek
```

Next, use `pnpm` to install the dependencies:
