# Jet Lag The Game: Hide and Seek Map Generator

A tool to trivially generate interactive maps for viewing hiding possibilities in Jet Lag The Game's Hide and Seek. So far, the following questions have been implemented:

- [x] Radius
  - [x] All
- [x] Thermometer
  - [x] All
- [ ] Matching
- [ ] Measuring

More documentation to come.

Note that only questions that are shown in the show will be used, for now. I do not want to "reveal" anything exclusive to The Home Game or take away from its success in any way.
